# Target Object Classes for Capstone Demo
# Subset of COCO dataset classes relevant for fetch-and-deliver tasks
# Full COCO classes: https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/datasets/coco.yaml

target_objects:
  # Tableware (common fetch tasks)
  - cup
  - mug
  - bottle
  - wine glass
  - bowl
  - spoon
  - fork
  - knife

  # Food items
  - apple
  - banana
  - orange
  - sandwich
  - pizza
  - donut
  - cake

  # Office items
  - book
  - laptop
  - mouse
  - keyboard
  - cell phone
  - remote

  # Household items
  - scissors
  - teddy bear
  - vase
  - clock
  - potted plant

# Detection parameters
detection_config:
  confidence_threshold: 0.6  # Minimum confidence to publish detection
  nms_threshold: 0.45  # Non-maximum suppression threshold (filter overlapping boxes)
  max_detections: 10  # Maximum detections per frame
  image_size: 640  # YOLO input size (640x640 default)

# Class-specific overrides (optional)
class_specific:
  mug:
    confidence_threshold: 0.7  # Higher threshold for mugs (reduce false positives)
  bottle:
    confidence_threshold: 0.65
  apple:
    confidence_threshold: 0.75  # Fruits often confused with other objects

# Mapping from LLM object names to COCO class names
llm_to_coco_mapping:
  # LLM might say "coffee mug" → "mug"
  "coffee mug": "mug"
  "water bottle": "bottle"
  "smartphone": "cell phone"
  "phone": "cell phone"
  "computer": "laptop"
  "pen": "pen"  # Not in COCO, would need custom training

# Notes:
# - COCO dataset has 80 classes total
# - YOLOv8 models (n/s/m/l/x) are pre-trained on COCO
# - For custom objects not in COCO, fine-tune YOLOv8 on custom dataset
# - See: https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/train/
